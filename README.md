# ShkolaSoftheme
Repository for ShkolaSoftheme study tasks.

Here are stored practical tasks for two subjects: C # and Angular.
Each task is in the form of a project in the folder with the name of the lecture.
Also in these folders there are text files describing the task.
In addition there are additional files that should be placed next
to the project's executable file, for its correct work.
